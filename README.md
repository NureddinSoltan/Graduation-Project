## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup (Django REST Framework)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd medical-assistant-backend
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Run the development server (use a free port like 8002):

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 8002
   ```

7. Admin Panel available at:

   ```
   http://localhost:8002/admin/
   ```

---

## üíª Frontend Setup (Vue + Vite + Tailwind)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd medical-assistant-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the app:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Port 5173 is used by default. If busy, Vite will pick a different one (e.g., 5174).

## üß™ Development Notes

* Vue frontend uses **`/chat`**, **`/signin`**, and **`/signup`** routes.
* All API requests point to `http://localhost:8002/api/` by default.
* Chat functionality will use a local `.safetensors` model when deployed (see next section).

---

## üß† Model Integration (WIP)

The backend will use a RoBERTa model via the Hugging Face Transformers pipeline with `.safetensors` weights stored locally in:

```
medical-assistant-backend/model/model.safetensors
```

Due to GitHub size limits, this file **is not committed**. You can manually download or share it via:

## üìå Requirements

* Python 3.12+
* Node.js 18+
* npm 9+
* Git LFS (for model tracking)
* CUDA 12.6+ for GPU acceleration (optional)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Backend**: Django 5.2.1, Django REST Framework, SimpleJWT, Djoser, HuggingFace Transformers
* **Frontend**: Vue 3, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios
* **Model**: RoBERTa with `.safetensors` (Hugging Face)
* **Authentication**: JWT, Djoser, Social Auth (optional)
